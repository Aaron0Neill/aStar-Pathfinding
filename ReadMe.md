# Visualised A* pathfinding algorithm 

### This project was created to demonstrate the use of A* pathfinding and I decided to make a visualised representation of the program, Not all paths between nodes carry the same weight.

In order to download and test this program you must have SFML installed on your machine. 
The start and end nodes are changable while the program is running, hoovering over a node and pressing either "LShift" or "LCtrl" will change the start or end node respectively.
